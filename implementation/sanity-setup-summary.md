# üèóÔ∏è Sanity Studio Setup Guide: Complete CMS Implementation

> **üìã Current Status:** Partial setup completed, ready for final implementation
> **üéØ Goal:** Complete Sanity Studio integration for product management
> **‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for full completion

## üìä **Current Progress Assessment**

### ‚úÖ **Already Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Basic Sanity configuration structure
- ‚úÖ Product schema foundation (`src/sanity/lib/schemaTypes/product.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Schema index setup (`src/sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Environment configuration files
- ‚úÖ Basic Sanity structure in place

### üîÑ **Remaining Tasks:**
1. **Complete Product Schema** - Add missing fields and validation
2. **Studio Configuration** - Set up studio interface and navigation
3. **Data Fetching** - Connect frontend to Sanity data
4. **Image Handling** - Implement Sanity image optimization
5. **Studio Deployment** - Get CMS accessible and working
6. **Testing & Integration** - Ensure everything works together
     - Embedded Studio at `/studio` route.
     - Selected the "Clean project" template for custom schemas.
     - Added project ID and dataset to `.env.local`.

3. **Installed Dependencies**
   - The CLI automatically installed required packages:
     - `@sanity/vision`
     - `sanity`
     - `@sanity/image-url`
     - `styled-components`

4. **Verified Embedded Studio**
   - Confirmed new files:
     - `/sanity.config.ts`, `/sanity.cli.ts`, `.env.local`
     - `/src/app/studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx`
     - `/src/sanity/` (for schemas and client)
   - No separate `/studio` folder was created; Studio is embedded via routing.

5. **Started Development Server**
   - Ran: `npm run dev`
   - Accessed Studio at: [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio)
   - Saw the Sanity login page, confirming successful setup.

---

## Next Steps

- Log in to Sanity Studio.
- Define custom product schemas in `/src/sanity/schemaTypes/`.
- Create and manage product documents in Studio.
- Integrate Sanity data into Next.js pages (carousel, `/my-toys`).

---

## Notes

- Sanity Studio is fully embedded in the Next.js app.
- All configuration is local; content is stored remotely in Sanity‚Äôs Content Lake.
- The setup is compatible with React 19 and Next.js 15 (see [Sanity React 19 compatibility guide](https://www.sanity.io/help/react-19)).
- Setup steps were partially based on [this article](https://www.sanity.io/learn/course/content-driven-web-application-foundations/create-a-new-sanity-project).
