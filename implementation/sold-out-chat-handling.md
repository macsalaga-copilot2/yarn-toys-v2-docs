# Sold-Out Product Chat Handling - Update Documentation

## What We've Implemented

### üö´ Problem Solved
Previously, the chat system allowed customers to attempt ordering sold-out products, which could lead to confusion and disappointment.

### ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Smart Button Behavior**
- **Available products**: "Chat to Order" button (blue/purple gradient)
- **Sold-out products**: "Chat for Custom Order" button (same styling, different text)

#### 2. **Enhanced Chat Widget**
- **New prop**: `available: boolean` passed from product pages
- **Dynamic greeting messages**: Different welcome messages for available vs sold-out products
- **Context-aware button sets**: Different action buttons based on product availability

#### 3. **Comprehensive Sold-Out Flow**

**Initial Options for Sold-Out Products:**
- üé® **Request Custom Order**: Full recreation of the exact design
- üìã **Check Material Availability**: See if materials are in stock
- üß∏ **Browse Available Toys**: Redirect to similar available products
- ‚ùì **Special Order Questions**: Help and information

#### 4. **Custom Order Process**

**Material Availability Check:**
- 70% chance materials are available (immediate start)
- 20% chance partial materials (1-2 week delay to order materials)
- 10% chance unavailable (suggest alternatives or modifications)

**Communication Options:**
- Direct email contact with Lialia (lialia@yarntoys.se)
- Chat-based coordination
- Material availability email checks

**Pricing & Timeline:**
- Same price as original product
- 50% upfront payment, 50% before shipping
- 1-2 week creation timeline
- Progress photos available on request

#### 5. **Fallback Options**

**Design Modifications:**
- Color changes (if different yarns available)
- Size variations (mini, standard, large)
- Style tweaks (accessories, expressions, details)

**Alternative Suggestions:**
- Email Lialia for similar available toys
- Browse gallery with guidance
- Custom design consultations

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified:
1. **ChatWidget.tsx**: Added `available` prop and new action handlers
2. **ProductDetails.tsx**: Pass `available` prop to chat widget
3. **ChatOrderButton.tsx**: Already handled availability display

#### New Action Handlers Added:
- `custom_order` - Main custom order flow
- `check_materials` - Material availability check

### üí¨ User Experience Improvements

**For Available Products:**

**For Sold-Out Products:**
