# Step 3 Accessibility Completion Summary

Date: 2025-08-16
Status: Baseline complete (contrast, focus, disabled states, automation)

## Achievements
- Contrast: All active text & focus indicators meet WCAG 2.1 AA (script verified).
- Tokens: Centralized accent palette + link, heading, ring, purple text tokens.
- Focus: Unified `--color-focus-ring` + global outline + documented pattern.
- Disabled States: Removed opacity-50 contrast loss; introduced `.is-disabled` utility.
- Automation: `a11y:scan` script + ESLint restrictions + GitHub Action workflow.
- Docs: Audit, focus pattern, progress log, completion summary.

## Residual Items (Low Priority)
- Additional semantic sweep for rarely used test/demo pages.
- Possible dark mode future mapping for focus ring.
- Optional snapshot test for presence of ring classes.

## Regression Guardrails
1. CI job blocks forbidden hex usage.
2. ESLint disallows deprecated palette in code.
3. Design tokens single source; new colors added only via tokens.

## Ready for Next Step
Proceed to next roadmap item (e.g., performance or semantic ARIA enhancements) with lower risk of a11y regressions.
